# Install connext
`$ npm install connext-js`

Connext is a middleware solution for Next.js with Express-style syntax that supports both global and flexible route-specific middleware. For global middleware, you must create a `controllers` folder that must contain a `global.js` controller file. We recommend also creating controller files for your other middleware as a way to modularize your API logic. 

## Setting Routes
Setting routes using `connext`closely resembles setting routes in Express. 

### Method
All valid HTTP request methods have associated methods on the connext object. 
```javascript
app.get();
app.post();
app.put();
app.delete();
app.head();
app.trace();
app.patch();
app.options();
app.connect();
```

### URL
Connext supports any static or queried API endpoint. Support for dynamic routing is coming soon. ⚡️

### Request & Response objects
In `connext`, you have access to the **request object** available in Next.js and that access persists through the middleware chain- just like Express! The available properties are `req.url`, `req.method`, and `req.body`.

Unlike Express, if you need to store data you can add any key to the **response object** with whatever data you wish to store. This will simply augment your response object and continue to persist this object throughout the lifecycle of the request. 
EX:
```javascript
response.data = JSON.stringify(data);
response.match = true;
response.array = ['I'm the data you need'];
```

## Middleware
Example file structure:
```
├── ...
├── controllers
│   ├── global.js        
│   └── middleware.js                 
├── pages                
│   └── api              
└── ...                   
```

### Global Middleware
To utilize Connext's global middleware functionality, you must create a `global.js` file in a folder called `controllers`. The `controllers` folder must be at the same level as your `pages` folder and export an **array**. 

`connext` has a simple global built-in error handler that will run whenever something is passed into the invocation of `next()`. If you'd like to use your own error handler, define it in `global.js` as the **last** element of the exported array. 

**global.js example**
```javascript
// a global middleware function
const globalOne = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('this the first function that runs!');
  return next();
};
// another global middleware function
const globalTwo = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('another one!');
  return next();
};
// global error handler
const errorHandler = (err, req, res, next) => {
  return res.status(500).send('an error occurred');
};
// export your array of global middleware
module.exports = [globalOne, globalTwo, errorHandler];
```

We recommend that you modularize your other middleware in one or more files in your `controllers` file to keep your code readable and easy to debug 🐞

**middleware.js example**
```javascript
const middlewareController = {};

middlewareController.functionOne = (req, res, next) => {
  // middleware functionality here
  return next();
}

middlewareController.functionTwo = (req, res, next) => {
  // middleware functionality here
  return next();
}

module.exports = middlewareController;
```

### connext.METHOD(url, [...middleware])

Like in express, every method in Connext has a string bound to it that coresponds with a valid HTTP method. 

For example: `GET, DELETE, POST`, etc.

## Use Case Example

To define a route using Connext, add a JavaScript file inside of Next.js's required `api` folder. 

```
├── pages                       
│   └── api                     
│       └── exampleRoute.js    
```

**Inside of the route file**

  1. Require in Connext and any route specific middleware controller files
  2. Create a new instantiation of Connext
  3. Set up routes by calling one of Connext-js's built in HTTP methods
     * Pass the current route in as the first argument
     * Chain any desired middleware functions in the order you want them to be invoked
     * An anonymous middleware function can be defined at the end of the middleware chain. This function will end the request cycle.
  4. You can invoke multiple HTTP methods in the same route file
  5. Set your Connext-js invocation as the route files export default function

``` javascript
const Connext = require('Connext-js');
const middleware = require('../../controllers/middleware');

const app = Connext();

app.get('/api/exampleRoute', middleware.one, middleware.two, (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json(res.example);
});
app.post('/api/exampleRoute', middleware.three, (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json(res.example);
});
app.delete('/api/exampleRoute', middleware.four, (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json(res.example);
});

export default app;
```
