I have been a part of the Ultimate Frisbee Community for 8 years now, competing at the high school, college, and club level. I have served as a captain on the Binghamton University team, and 2 summers ago, I even founded Pink Pear, a club team for Binghamton University alumni. Since graduating, I hope to train hard enough over this coming year to make it onto one of the top club teams in the region!
