## About Us

Geist Software Solutions is a team of open source developers passionate about identifying and creating solutions for common problems found in the open source framework community. Currently we are partnered with OS-Labs, a tech accelerator based out of New York and LA. We have been working to bridge the gap between Next.js and Express without adding unnecessary bulk to web applications.

### Current Packages

Our first NPM library, Dirext.js, is a lightweight, framework agnostic, routing solution for Node JS. Connext.js was created to allow for custom and route specific middleware in Next.js without the use of an additional server.

If you are interested in contributing to Connext.js or Dirext.js, or wish to  learn more about OS-Labs, please follow the links below.
