## Info

Geist software solutions is a team of open source developers passionate about creating flexible solutions for common problems in open source frameworks. Currently we are partnered with OS-Labs, a tech accelerator based out of New York and LA, and are seeking to bridge the gap between Next.js and Express without adding unnecessary bulk to web applications.

### Current Packages

Our first NPM package, Dirext, is a lightweight, framework agnostic, routing solution for Node JS. Connext was created to allow for custom and route specific middleware in Next.js without the use of an additional server.

If you are interested in contributing to Connext or Direx, or wish to  learn more about OS-Labs, please follow the links below.
